    For my capstone project, I'm working on a team to create an analytics portal for the company Parlay Analytics. They have
    a phone app that allows users to place bets on sports games. We are creating a web app to allow stakeholders to visualize
    data about these bets. I am mainly working on the backend.
- title: "Markov Decision Processes"
  date: Fall 2019
  description: >-
    For CSCI 360&#58; Artificial Intelligence, I created three solvers for Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The first two solvers,
    using value iteration and policy iteration, can be used to solve MDPs where the dynamics are known a priori. The final solver
    uses q-learning and is useful when the dynamics of the MDP are not known a priori.

    For CSCI 360&#58; Artificial Intelligence, I created a single-agent path finder using time-space A* and two multi-agent path finders, 
    one using prioritized planning and the other using conflict-based search.
    conflict-based search.
- title: "Neural Network for Handwritten Numbers"
  date: Fall 2019
  description: >-
    For CSCI 360&#58; Artificial Intelligence, I created a neural network. The network uses images from the MNIST handwritten digit
    database for training and testing data, and it uses back propogation to learn to classify these handwritten numbers.
- title: "Scheme Interpreter"
  date: Spring 2019
  description: >-
    For my final project for CSCI 499&#58; Concepts in Programming Languages, I wrote a Scheme interpreter in Java. The program
    reads valid Scheme syntax as user input, evaluates it, and writes the output.

    As part of CSCI 310&#58; Software Engineering, I was in a semester-long group project. We made an Android app that was Tindr for
    books. Once signed in, users can upload books that they want to sell/trade and browse other users' books in a similar fashion
    to Tindr. If two users match, they are brought to a chat screen to complete their transaction.

    The final project of CSCI 201&#58; Principles of Software Development was a group project. My group created a social media iOS
    app. Once signed in, users can leave audio, visual, and text messages at geographic locations around USC's campus. Other users can
    then find these messages dropped around campus. It's like a campus-wide treasure hunt!
