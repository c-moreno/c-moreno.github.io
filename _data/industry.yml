      description: >-
        At this hackathon, I participated in the category to decrease bullying in schools. My group created an iOS app to teach
        elementary school students about harassment. The structure of the game is based on flappy bird, except
        instead of avoiding structures, the user wants to hit houses. When the user hits a house, they get a scenario related to bullying
        and are given several options on how to react. At the end of the game, based on the reactions they chose, the app gives them
        feedback about how they typically respond in these situations and how they might respond differently. Our project was awarded
        runner-up for best iOS app. An alternate link to a YouTube video of the demo can be found
