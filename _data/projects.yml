      description: >-
        I participated in an overnight Hackathon with a theme of decreasing bullying in schools. My group created an iOS app to teach 
        elementary school students about harassment. The structure of the game is based on flappy bird, except
        instead of avoiding structures, the user wants to hit houses. When the user hits a house, they get a scenario related to bullying
        and are given several options on how to react. At the end of the game, based on the reactions they chose, the app gives them 
        feedback about how they typically respond in these situations and how they might respond differently. Our project was awarded 
        Runner-up for best iOS app.

        As part of CSCI 310&#58; Software Engineering, I was in a semester-long group project. We made an Android app that was Tindr for
        books. Once signed in, users can upload books that they want to sell/trade and browse other users' books in a similar fashion
        to Tindr. If two users match, they are brought to a chat screen to complete their transaction.

        The final project of CSCI 201&#58; Principles of Software Development was a group project. My group created a social media iOS
        app. Once signed in, users can leave audio, visual, and text messages at geographic locations around USC's campus. Other users can
        then find these messages dropped around campus. It's like a campus-wide treasure hunt!

        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. 
        Throughout the summer I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate these devices. At the end of the summer I presented
        my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium. Here are links to my <a href="../resources/microfluidics_poster.png">poster</a>
