<p>I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California studying computer science (CS) and English, specifically creative writing. It’s an odd combination, but it’s nice to keep both sides of my brain engaged. During the school year, I work as a course producer (essentially an undergraduate teaching assistant) for undergraduate CS theory courses. I love teaching and sharing my enthusiasm for the subject, and I especially enjoy the puzzle of how to communicate abstract concepts in the best way for a particular student.</p>

<p>Because I’ve enjoyed my job as a course producer so much (and in a large part because of the influential teachers and professors I’ve had over the years), I’ve wanted to pursue a teaching career for quite some time. Up until last semester, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to teach CS at the high school or university level. However, I took a theory of computation class last semester that made that decision easy. I fell in love with the math side of computer science, particularly complexity theory, and I want to contribute to the field.</p>

<p>My long term goals are not only to contribute to CS theory through research, but also to make the subject more accessible. Too often I’ve seen students brush off CS theory as academic and inapplicable, and I believe this is due to a lack of effective communication. Theory professors often take their years of experience for granted, losing touch with how little background knowledge students have. By focusing on communicating with students at their level of understanding, I hope to make CS theory more appealing. Becoming a professor seems like the perfect career path for me because it combines my passion for teaching, drive to research, and need to continue actively learning.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active. I played on <a href="http://www.uscwomensultimate.com/">USC’s club ultimate frisbee team</a> for the first two years of college, and I’ve been on the triathlon team since my sophomore year. I also love hiking and backpacking and am a guide for <a href="http://scoutfitters.org/">USC’s outdoor club</a>.</p>

<p>I’m also a part of <a href="https://www.troycamp.org/">Troy Camp</a>. One of the things I’ve had trouble with in college is exclusively being around people my own age. I’ve participated in a variety of K-12 tutoring and mentoring programs, and finally found my home in Troy Camp my junior year. We provide after school tutoring and mentoring programs for 3rd-12th graders. I’ve been involved with the high school program as well as several of the elementary programs (my favorite being an after-school dance class, although it was mostly me learning how to dance from the kids…) For me, the most memorable part of Troy Camp is the part it’s named after, a week-long sleepaway camp during the summer. Last summer I was a cabin counselor and spent the week with a group of ten wild and wonderful 4th grade boys. I’m excited to continue hanging out with them during our activities throughout the school year.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see where I end up in the next few years. My career path is flexible, but I hope to find something that keeps me learning, teaching, and engaging both mentally and with my community.</p>
