    <li><strong><a href="/resources/secure_multi_party_computation_paper.pdf">Introduction to Secure Multi-Party Computation: Garbled Circuits</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2019</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">For my course CSCI 476&#58; Cryptography: Secure Communication and Computation, I researched secure multi-party computation (SMPC), focusing on Yao's garbled circuits. I wrote my term paper on garbled circuits, and I presented our class' first lecture on SMPC. My slides can be viewed <a href="/resources/secure_multi_party_computation_presentation.pdf">here</a>, and my paper can be seen <a href="/resources/secure_multi_party_computation_paper.pdf">here</a>. </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/dynamic_programming_handout.pdf">Dynamic Programming Supplemental Handout</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2019</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This is a supplemental handout I wrote while course producing CSCI 270&#58; Introduction to Algorithms and the Theory of Computing. Many of the students felt that they could understand dynamic programming solutions when we presented them, but had trouble coming up with the solutions on their own. In my opinion, creative problem solving is the most important skill to take away from this class, so I wrote this handout hoping it would provide students with an approach to solving dynamic programming problems. </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/blockchain_security.pdf">Security of Blockchain</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2019</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This is a glimpse into how Blockchain works and the mathematics behind its security. I wrote this for CSCI 476&#58; Introduction to Modern Cryptography. The audience is meant to have a basic understanding of cryptography and probability. </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/godel_incompleteness_theorem.pdf">G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem</a> </strong>&raquo; Spring 2019</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This was my final paper for CSCI 499&#58; Theory of Computation. This is a detailed summary of G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem written for an audience of CS undergraduates. Although &mdash; perhaps because &mdash; G&ouml;del's paper took me more hours to read than there were pages, I had a lot of fun working on this project. </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation.pdf">Research Proposal: Automated Poetry Generation</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2018</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This is the research proposal for my honors undergraduate thesis. This proposal details past research on poetry generation, past research on creative generation using deep learning, and my plan to combine the best of these techniques towards automated poetry generation. I presented my proposal at the Viterbi Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation_presentation.pdf">here</a>, and my research proposal can be seen <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation.pdf">here</a> </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/cryptography_handout.pdf">Number Theory and Cryptography Supplemental Handout</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2018</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This is a supplemental handout I helped write when I was course producing CSCI 270&#58; Introduction to Algorithms and the Theory of Computing. Many of the students were struggling with the concepts of number theory and cryptography that were presented in lecture, so I wrote this handout in conjunction with the professor. My main contribution was "Section 2&#58; Public-Key Cryptography." </p>
  
    <li><strong><a href="/resources/p_vs_np.pdf">The Million Dollar Question: How Hard is that Problem?</a> </strong>&raquo; Fall 2018</li>
    <p style="margin-left:20px">This is a magazine article I wrote for WRIT 340&#58; Technical Writing. P vs NP is a famous topic in CS theory. This article is meant for the average person and aims to explain the question of P =? NP as well as why it's important. </p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px">I wrote this short story for ENGL 298&#58; Introduction to the Genre of Fiction. The title and format are inspired by Lorrie Moore's book of Short Stories <i>Self-Help</i> (which I highly recommend).  I recently got this story published in <i>Introducing Magazine</i>. </p>
