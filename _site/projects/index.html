        <li><strong>Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition using Triggers</strong></li>
      

      <p style="margin-left:10px">I'm on a team using distantly-supervised machine learning to develop a novel approach to recognizing named entities (such as people or chemicals) in sentences. The basic idea is that we use a small amount of human-annotated data consisting of sentences with their words categorically-labeled as well as labeled trigger phrases that signal a named entity. We use the trigger phrases to generate weakly-labeled sentences, which are used in combination with our original categorically-labeled data to train a sentence labeling network. My responsibilities are to implement and test the machine learning algorithms as well as help to write our research paper. </p>

      <p style="margin-left:10px">I am being advised by <a href="http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/">Dr. Xiang Ren</a> for my undergraduate honors thesis. I created a research proposal to use deep learning for automated poetry generation. Deep learning has been successful for creative image and sound generation, and I am working on modifying these existing techniques for the use of poetry generation. I presented my proposal at the Viterbi Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation_presentation.pdf">here</a>. </p>

      <p style="margin-left:10px">I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. Extensional viscosity is a fluid's resistance to stretching. In highly viscous fluids, this can be measured with equipment that stretches a droplet until it breaks. However, low-viscosity fluids break too quickly to measure accurately. I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate new devices to measure extensional viscosity in low-viscosity fluids. At the end of the summer I presented my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium. Here are links to my <a href="../resources/microfluidics_poster.png">poster</a> and <a href="../resources/microfluidics_presentation.pdf">slide deck</a>. </p>

          <li><strong>Office Document Integrations with Microsoft Whiteboard App</strong></li>
        
        <p style="margin-left:10px">I created a feature to support the import of Office documents into the Microsoft Whiteboard App. This project was end-to-end, requiring me to work across project management, design, business operations, and software development. Within software development, I built the user interface for inserting Office documents and created the backend framework to convert and insert documents. The feature was released to the  public in October 2019. I learned networking and C# throughout the process. </p>

        <p style="margin-left:10px">Q# is a programming language that Microsoft is developing for quantum computing. As part of Microsoft's company-wide hackathon, I worked on a team to create code actions for Q# within VS Code. I created code actions to replace the deprecated NOT, OR, and AND operators. From this project, I learned how to work with the syntax trees representing Q# files. </p>

        <p style="margin-left:10px">Facebook develops a software development kit (SDK) that allows third-party developers to integrate Facebook within their own iOS app. One of the benefits of this integration is that the third-party app can provide analytics that benefit that app's ad campaigns on Facebook. I implemented a new approach to app event tracking within the SDK, empowering outside developers with better data on how their app is used. This project was full-stack and involved PHP and Objective-C. </p>

        <p style="margin-left:10px">I recreated Metro Paws' silicone doggy bag dispenser. They've used the same manufacturing mold for years and were interested in changing the design based on customer feedback and to remedy manufacturing difficulties they were having. As the only person in the company with an engineering background (at that point I was studying mechanical engineering), I created CAD drawings that incorporated the design team's ideas and simplified the design process. I also researched, interviewed, and selected alternate manufacturing facilities. </p>

        <p style="margin-left:10px">At this hackathon, I participated in the category to decrease bullying in schools. My group created an iOS app to teach elementary school students about harassment. The structure of the game is based on flappy bird, except instead of avoiding structures, the user wants to hit houses. When the user hits a house, they get a scenario related to bullying and are given several options on how to react. At the end of the game, based on the reactions they chose, the app gives them feedback about how they typically respond in these situations and how they might respond differently. Our project was awarded runner-up for best iOS app. An alternate link to a YouTube video of the demo can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/GxPAcWDHeq0">here</a>. </p>

      <p style="margin-left:10px">For CSCI 360&#58; Artificial Intelligence, I created three solvers for Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The first two solvers, using value iteration and policy iteration, can be used to solve MDPs where the dynamics are known a priori. The final solver uses q-learning and is useful when the dynamics of the MDP are not known a priori. </p>

      <p style="margin-left:10px">As part of CSCI 310&#58; Software Engineering, I was in a semester-long group project. We made an Android app that was Tindr for books. Once signed in, users can upload books that they want to sell/trade and browse other users' books in a similar fashion to Tindr. If two users match, they are brought to a chat screen to complete their transaction. </p>

      <p style="margin-left:10px">The final project of CSCI 201&#58; Principles of Software Development was a group project. My group created a social media iOS app. Once signed in, users can leave audio, visual, and text messages at geographic locations around USC's campus. Other users can then find these messages dropped around campus. It's like a campus-wide treasure hunt! </p>
