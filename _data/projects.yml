        At this point I was a mechanical engineering major, so my project involved redesigning their doggy bag dispenser. I
        created new designs using AutoCAD and researched, interviewed, and selected alternate manufacturing facilities.

      description: >-
        At this hackathon, I participated in the category to decrease bullying in schools. My group created an iOS app to teach
        elementary school students about harassment. The structure of the game is based on flappy bird, except
        instead of avoiding structures, the user wants to hit houses. When the user hits a house, they get a scenario related to bullying
        and are given several options on how to react. At the end of the game, based on the reactions they chose, the app gives them
        feedback about how they typically respond in these situations and how they might respond differently. Our project was awarded
        runner-up for best iOS app. An alternate link to a YouTube video of the demo can be found

        For my capstone project, I'm working on a team to create an analytics portal for the company Parlay Analytics. They have
        a phone app that allows users to place bets on sports games. We are creating a web app to allow stakeholders to visualize
        data about these bets. My contribution is mainly backend work.

      date: Fall 2019
      description: >-
        For CSCI 360&#58; Artificial Intelligence, I created a neural network. The network uses images from the MNIST handwritten digit
        database for training and testing data, and it uses back propogation to learn to classify these handwritten numbers.

        For my final project for CSCI 499&#58; Concepts in Programming Languages, I wrote a Scheme interpreter in Java. The program
        reads valid Scheme syntax as user input, evaluates it, and writes the output.

        As part of CSCI 310&#58; Software Engineering, I was in a semester-long group project. We made an Android app that was Tindr for
        books. Once signed in, users can upload books that they want to sell/trade and browse other users' books in a similar fashion
        to Tindr. If two users match, they are brought to a chat screen to complete their transaction.

        The final project of CSCI 201&#58; Principles of Software Development was a group project. My group created a social media iOS
        app. Once signed in, users can leave audio, visual, and text messages at geographic locations around USC's campus. Other users can
        then find these messages dropped around campus. It's like a campus-wide treasure hunt!
