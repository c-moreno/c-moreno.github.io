    This was my final paper for CSCI 499&#58; Theory of Computation. This is a detailed summary of 
    G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem written for an audience of CS undergraduates. 
    Although &mdash; perhaps because &mdash; G&ouml;del's paper took me more hours to read than there were pages, 
    I had a lot of fun working on this project.

    This is a potential research proposal for my honors senior thesis. This proposal details
    past research on poetry generation, past research on creative generation using deep learning, and
    my plan to combine the best of these techniques towards automatic poetry generation.

    This is a supplemental handout I wrote when I was course producing CSCI 270&#58; Introduction to Algorithms
    and the Theory of Computing. Many of the students were struggling with the concepts of number theory and cryptography 
    that were presented in lecture, so I wrote this handout in conjunction with the professor. My main contribution was 
    "Section 2&#58; Public-Key Cryptography."

    This is a magazine article I wrote for WRIT 340&#58; Technical Writing. P vs NP is a famous
    topic within computer science. This article is meant for the average person and 
    aims to explain the question of P =? NP as well as why it's important.
