      description: >-
        I'm on a team using distantly-supervised machine learning to develop a novel approach to recognizing named entities
        (such as people or chemicals) in sentences.
        The basic idea is that we will use a small amount of human-annotated data to recognize trigger phrases for different categories of
        named entities. Then we will use existing machine learning techniques to annotate new entities using these trigger phrases. My
        responsibilities are to implement and test the machine learning algorithms.

        The USC Interaction Lab is dedicated to human-robot interaction. The project I assisted with uses socially assistive
        robotics to help children with autism communicate and interact. I had a wide variety of tasks, the majority of which
        involved using Solidworks to design objects to hold robots and their parts.

      description: >-
        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. Extensional
        viscosity is a fluid's resistance to stretching. In highly viscous fluids, this can be measured with equipment that stretches a droplet until it breaks.
        However, low-viscosity fluids break too quickly to measure accurately. I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate
        new devices to measure extensional viscosity in low-viscosity fluids. At the end of the summer I presented my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium.
