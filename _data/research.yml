    - title: Auxiliary Learning for Named Entity Recognition
      description: >-
        My team is working to develop novel approaches to recognizing named entities (such as people or chemicals) in sentences.
        We are investigating the use of using auxiliary learning -- training towards multiple, related goals -- to increase
        the effectiveness of our existing methods for named entity recognition. This is an ongoing project and will be the basis
        of my undergraduate honors thesis.

    - title: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition using Triggers
      description: >-
        My team used distantly-supervised machine learning to develop a novel approach to named entity recognition.
        The basic idea is that we use a small amount of human-annotated data consisting of sentences with their words categorically labeled
        as well as labeled trigger phrases that signal a named entity. We use the trigger phrases to generate weakly labeled sentences, which
        are used in combination with our original categorically labeled data to train a sentence labeling network.
        My responsibilities were to implement and test the machine learning algorithms as well as help to write our manuscript, submitted
        for publication in December 2019.

      description: >-
        I developed a research proposal to use deep learning for automated poetry generation.
        Deep learning has been successful for creative image and sound generation, and I developed a proposal to
        modify these existing techniques for the use of poetry generation.
        I presented my proposal at the Viterbi Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed

      description: >-
        The USC Interaction Lab is dedicated to human-robot interaction. The project I assisted with uses socially assistive
        robotics to help children with autism communicate and interact. I had a wide variety of tasks, the majority of which
        involved using Solidworks to design objects to hold robots and their parts.

      description: >-
        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. Extensional
        viscosity is a fluid's resistance to stretching. In highly viscous fluids, this can be measured with equipment that stretches a droplet until it breaks.
        However, low-viscosity fluids break too quickly to measure accurately. I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate
        new devices to measure extensional viscosity in low-viscosity fluids. At the end of the summer I presented my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium.
