I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California studying computer science (CS) and creative writing. It's an odd combination, but it's nice to keep both sides of my brain engaged. During the schoolyear, I work as a course producer (essentialy an undergraduate teaching assistant) for undergraduate CS courses. This is one of my favorite things I do. I love teaching and sharing my enthusiasm for the subject, and I especially enjoy holding office hours, where working with each student is a different puzzle in how to convey the material in a way that works best for them. 

Because I've enjoyed my job as a course producer so much (and in a large part because of the influential teachers and professors I've had over the years), I've wanted to pursue a teaching career for a while. Up until last semester, I wasn't sure if I wanted to teach CS at a high school or university level. However, I took a theory of computation class last semester that made that decision easy. I fell in love with the math side of computer science, particularly complexity theory, and I want to research and push the boundaries of knowledge in the field. 

Becoming a professor seems like the perfect career path for me because it combines my passion for teaching, drive to research, and need to continue actively learning. In order to pursue this goal, I'm planning on attending graduate school to pursue a PhD in CS theory, with the possibility of taking a gap year to finish my creative writing major in an extra semester.

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active. I played on <a href="http://www.uscwomensultimate.com/">USC's club ultimate frisbee team</a> for the first two of college, and I've been on the triathlon team since my sophomore year. I also love hiking and backpacking, and will be a guide for <a href="http://scoutfitters.org/">USC's outdoor club</a> my senior year.

I'm also a part of <a href="https://www.troycamp.org/">Troy Camp</a>. One of the things I've had trouble with in college is exclusively being around people my own age. I've participated in a variety of K-12 tutoring and mentoring programs, and finally found my home in Troy Camp my junior year. We provide after school tutoring and mentoring programs for 3rd-12th graders. I've been involved with the high school program as well as several of the elementary programs (my favorite being an after school dance class, although it was mostly me learning how to dance from the kids...) For me, the most memorable part of Troy Camp is the part it's named after, a week-long sleepaway camp during the summer. Last summer I was a cabin counselor and had a group of ten wild and wonderful 4th grade boys. I'm really looking forward to hanging out with them throughout our activities during the school year.

I'm excited to see where I end up in the next few years. My career path is flexible, but I hope to find something that allows me to continue learning and teaching and keeps me engaged both mentally and with my community.
