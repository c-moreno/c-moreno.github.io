    - title: "Office Document Integrations with Microsoft Whiteboard App"
      description: >-
        I created a feature to support the import of Office documents into the Microsoft Whiteboard App. This project was end-to-end, requiring
        me to work across project management, design, business operations, and software development. Within software development, I built the user
        interface for inserting Office documents and created the backend framework to convert and insert documents. The feature was released to the 
        public in October 2019. I learned networking and C# throughout the process.

        Q# is a programming language that Microsoft is developing for quantum computing. As part of Microsoft's company-wide hackathon,
        I worked on a team to create code actions for Q# within VS Code. I created code actions to replace the deprecated NOT, OR, and
        AND operators. From this project, I learned how to work with the syntax trees representing Q# files.

      description: >-
        Facebook develops a software development kit (SDK) that allows third-party developers to integrate Facebook within their own
        iOS app. One of the benefits of this integration is that the third-party app can provide analytics that benefit that app's ad
        campaigns on Facebook. I implemented a new approach to app event tracking within the SDK, empowering outside developers with
        better data on how their app is used. This project was full-stack and involved PHP and Objective-C.

        As part of a Facebook hackathon, I worked with another intern to design and implement a new timeline privacy setting.

    - title: "Redesign of Doggy Bag Dispenser"
      description: >-
        I recreated Metro Paws' silicone doggy bag dispenser. They've used the same manufacturing mold for years and were
        interested in changing the design based on customer feedback and to remedy manufacturing difficulties they were having.
        As the only person in the company with an engineering background (at that point I was studying mechanical engineering),
        I created CAD drawings that incorporated the design team's ideas and simplified the design process. I also researched, interviewed,
        and selected alternate manufacturing facilities.
    - title: "Researching Eco-Friendly Materials"
      description: >-
        I worked on several side projects, including researching alternate manufacturing materials that would
        make our products more environmentally sustainable.

      description: >-
        At this hackathon, I participated in the category to decrease bullying in schools. My group created an iOS app to teach
        elementary school students about harassment. The structure of the game is based on flappy bird, except
        instead of avoiding structures, the user wants to hit houses. When the user hits a house, they get a scenario related to bullying
        and are given several options on how to react. At the end of the game, based on the reactions they chose, the app gives them
        feedback about how they typically respond in these situations and how they might respond differently. Our project was awarded
        runner-up for best iOS app. An alternate link to a YouTube video of the demo can be found
