      description: >-
        Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of extracting named entities from text and classifying them using pre-defined
        categories (e.g. persons, locations, or organizations).
        State-of-the-art NER models necessitate significant amounts of human-annotated ground-truth data, and the process of annotation
        is expensive and time consuming.
        Thus, a crucial research question is how we can more efficiently collect and use human-annotated ground-truth data.
        The two projects below -- adversarial data augmentation and entity triggers -- explore data efficiency in named entity recognition.
        These two projects also make up my honors undergraduate thesis.

    - title: Adversarial Data Augmentation for Named Entity Recognition
      description: >-
        I am exploring automated methods to develop adversarial data, test data which is created by perturbing a correctly classified example,
        causing the model to misclassify the adversarial example. Adversarial examples are useful because they demonstrate the limits
        of state-of-the-art NER models which can guide future research directions for making models more robust. Further, I am investigating
        the use of adversarial training -- generating additional training data by using the same augmentation methods used for
        adversarial training. This project is ongoing.

    - title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07493">TriggerNER&#58; Learning with Entity Triggers as Explanations for Named Entity Recognition</a>
      description: >-
        My team used distantly-supervised machine learning to develop a novel approach to named entity recognition.
        The basic idea is that we use a small amount of human-annotated data consisting of sentences with their words categorically labeled
        as well as labeled trigger phrases that signal a named entity. We use the trigger phrases to recognize semantically similar in
        unlabeled sentences, providing additional supervision  when labeling the words of these sentences.
        My responsibilities were to help implement the machine learning algorithms and help write our manuscript. Our research paper was
        accepted into the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2020.

      description: >-
        I developed a research proposal to use deep learning for automated poetry generation.
        Deep learning has been successful for creative image and sound generation, and I developed a proposal to
        modify these existing techniques for the use of poetry generation.
        I presented my proposal at the Viterbi Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed
        <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation_presentation.pdf">here</a>. This research paper received
        1st place for the Viterbi Award for Best Research Paper.

        The USC Interaction Lab is dedicated to human-robot interaction. The project I assisted with uses socially assistive
        robotics to help children with autism communicate and interact. I had a wide variety of tasks, the majority of which
        involved using Solidworks to design objects to hold robots and their parts.

      description: >-
        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. Extensional
        viscosity is a fluid's resistance to stretching. In highly viscous fluids, this can be measured with equipment that stretches a droplet until it breaks.
        However, low-viscosity fluids break too quickly to measure accurately. I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate
        new devices to measure extensional viscosity in low-viscosity fluids. At the end of the summer I presented my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium.
