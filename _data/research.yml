    - title: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition using Triggers
      description: >-
        I'm on a team using distantly-supervised machine learning to develop a novel approach to recognizing named entities
        (such as people or chemicals) in sentences.
        The basic idea is that we use a small amount of human-annotated data consisting of sentences with their words categorically-labeled
        as well as labeled trigger phrases that signal a named entity. We use the trigger phrases to generate weakly-labeled sentences, which
        are used in combination with our original categorically-labeled data to train a sentence labeling network.
        My responsibilities are to implement and test the machine learning algorithms as well as help to write our research paper.

      description: >-
        I am being advised by <a href="http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/">Dr. Xiang Ren</a> for my undergraduate honors thesis. I created a
        research proposal to use deep learning for automated poetry generation.
        Deep learning has been successful for creative image and sound generation, and I am working on
        modifying these existing techniques for the use of poetry generation.
        I presented my proposal at the Viterbi Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed

        The USC Interaction Lab is dedicated to human-robot interaction. The project I assisted with uses socially assistive
        robotics to help children with autism communicate and interact. I had a wide variety of tasks, the majority of which
        involved using Solidworks to design objects to hold robots and their parts.

      description: >-
        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids. Extensional
        viscosity is a fluid's resistance to stretching. In highly viscous fluids, this can be measured with equipment that stretches a droplet until it breaks.
        However, low-viscosity fluids break too quickly to measure accurately. I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate
        new devices to measure extensional viscosity in low-viscosity fluids. At the end of the summer I presented my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium.
