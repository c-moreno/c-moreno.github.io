      description: >-
        I am working on a team to develop a novel approach to recognizing named entities (such as people or chemicals) in sentences.
        The basic idea is that we will use a small amount of human-annotated data to recognize trigger phrases for different categories of
        named entities. Then we will use existing machine learning techniques to annotate new entities using these trigger phrases.

        The USC Interaction Lab is dedicated to human-robot interaction. The project I assisted with uses socially assistive
        robotics to help children with autism communicate and interact. I had a wide variety of tasks, the majority of which
        involved using Solidworks to design objects to hold robots and their parts.

      description: >-
        I worked with the microfluidics research team to develop microfluidic devices to measure the extensional viscosity of liquids.
        Throughout the summer I used 3D printing, photolithography, and soft lithography to fabricate these devices. At the end of the summer I presented
        my findings at the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Symposium. Here are links to my <a href="../resources/microfluidics_poster.png">poster</a>
        and <a href="../resources/microfluidics_presentation.pdf">slide deck</a>.
