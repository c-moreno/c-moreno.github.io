  description: >-
    For my course CSCI 476&#58; Cryptography: Secure Communication and Computation,
    I researched secure multi-party computation (SMPC), focusing on Yao's garbled circuits.
    I wrote my term paper on garbled circuits, and I presented our class' first lecture on SMPC.
    My slides can be viewed <a href="/resources/secure_multi_party_computation_presentation.pdf">here</a>, and my
    paper can be seen <a href="/resources/secure_multi_party_computation_paper.pdf">here</a>.

- title: "Dynamic Programming Supplemental Handout"

  date: "Fall 2019"
  description: >-
    This is a supplemental handout I wrote while course producing CSCI 270&#58; Introduction to Algorithms
    and the Theory of Computing. Many of the students felt that they could understand dynamic programming solutions
    when we presented them, but had trouble coming up with the solutions on their own. In my opinion, creative problem
    solving is the most important skill to take away from this class, so I wrote this handout hoping it would
    provide students with an approach to solving dynamic programming problems.

    This is a glimpse into how Blockchain works and the mathematics behind its security. I wrote
    this for CSCI 476&#58; Introduction to Modern Cryptography. The audience is meant to have a basic understanding of
    cryptography and probability.

    This was my final paper for CSCI 499&#58; Theory of Computation. This is a detailed summary of
    G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem written for an audience of CS undergraduates.
    Although &mdash; perhaps because &mdash; G&ouml;del's paper took me more hours to read than there were pages,
    I had a lot of fun working on this project.

- title: "Research Proposal: Automated Poetry Generation"

  description: >-
    This is the research proposal for my honors undergraduate thesis. This proposal details
    past research on poetry generation, past research on creative generation using deep learning, and
    my plan to combine the best of these techniques towards automated poetry generation. I presented my proposal at the Viterbi
    Student Speaker Symposium in November 2019. My slides can be viewed
    <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation_presentation.pdf">here</a>, and my research proposal can be
    seen <a href="/resources/automated_poetry_generation.pdf">here</a>

- title: "Number Theory and Cryptography Supplemental Handout"
  url: "/resources/cryptography_handout.pdf"
  date: "Fall 2018"
  description: >-
    This is a supplemental handout I helped write when I was course producing CSCI 270&#58; Introduction to Algorithms
    and the Theory of Computing. Many of the students were struggling with the concepts of number theory and cryptography
    that were presented in lecture, so I wrote this handout in conjunction with the professor. My main contribution was
    "Section 2&#58; Public-Key Cryptography."

- title: "The Million Dollar Question: How Hard is that Problem?"
  url: "/resources/p_vs_np.pdf"
  date: "Fall 2018"
  description: >-
    This is a magazine article I wrote for WRIT 340&#58; Technical Writing. P vs NP is a famous
    topic within computer science. This article is meant for the average person and
    aims to explain the question of P =? NP as well as why it's important.
