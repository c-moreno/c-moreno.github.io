I'm currently a Ph.D. in computer science (CS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I serve as
a teaching assistant for the undergraduate algorithms course. I'm particularly
interested in the intersection of CS and medicine, and I hope to work in assistive robotics.
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Southern California in May 2020, where I majored in computer science and minored in English, focusing on creative writing. It seems like an odd combination at first glance. However, my English classes have greatly contributed to my ability to communicate technical concepts, both through writing and verbally. During the school year, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for several introductory CS courses. I love teaching and sharing my enthusiasm for CS, and I especially enjoy the puzzle of finding the best way to communicate an abstract concept for a particular student.

<!-- Because I enjoyed my job as a course producer so much (and in a large part because of the influential teachers and professors I've had over the years), I've wanted to pursue a teaching career for quite some time. After taking CS theory technical electives, I fell in love with the math side of computer science, particularly complexity theory, the quantification of the difficulty of computational problems. -->

<!-- With this in mind, I began pursuing a Ph.D. in CS theory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Fall 2020. My long term goals are not only to contribute to CS theory through research, but also to make the subject more accessible. Too often Iâ€™ve seen students brush off CS theory as academic and inapplicable, and I believe this is due to a lack of effective communication. By focusing on communicating with students at their level of understanding, I hope to make CS theory more appealing. Becoming a professor seems like the perfect career path for me because it combines my passion for teaching, drive to research, and need to continue actively learning. -->

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active. I played on <a href="http://www.uscwomensultimate.com/">USC's club ultimate frisbee team</a> for the first two years of undergrad, and I raced with the triathlon team for my last three years. I also love hiking and backpacking and was a guide for <a href="http://scoutfitters.org/">USC's outdoor club</a>.

I was also a part of <a href="https://www.troycamp.org/">Troy Camp</a>. One of the things I had trouble with in college was exclusively being around people my own age. I participated in a variety of K-12 tutoring and mentoring programs, and finally found my home in Troy Camp my junior year. We provide after school tutoring and mentoring programs for 3rd-12th graders. I was involved with the high school program as well as several of the elementary programs (my favorite being an after-school dance class, although it was mostly me learning how to dance from the kids...) For me, the most memorable part of Troy Camp was the part it's named after, a week-long sleepaway camp during the summer. The summer after my junior year I was a cabin counselor and spent the week with a group of ten wild and wonderful 4th grade boys, who I got to continue hanging out with during our activities throughout the following school year.

I'm excited to see where I end up after graduate school. My career path is flexible, but I hope to find something that keeps me learning, teaching, and engaging with my community.
